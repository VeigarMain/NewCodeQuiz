## Homework 4-Code Quiz

## Description 
#Summary I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a quiz based on 
my faviorte game/champion. In this homework, I use Javascript to make changes to my HTML 
document and I also use some .append objects to fluctuate between HTML pages.

###Features 

A start button, which will start the quiz and bring the user to a new window that holds an array of multiple choice questions.

Once the user clicks an answer they will be prompted a message that they either got it wrong/right with a score. There is a timer implemented on each question screen, 
that will deduct 10 points from the users score if they don't answer the question in the given time frame.
Instead of creating a next button, I created a function that will inherently change the quiz box to a new 
quiz page with another array of questions. Once the user is finished answering all the questions, they will
be taken to a new box that will tell the user "All done!" The user will be given a chance to enter their intials into a submit box.
There will also be a prompted text of "End of quiz! You got ?? correct!". Once you submit your intitals, the user will appended to a 
high score page. Once the user is at the high score page, they will be able to view their high score, and other users high scores.
The user will be able to restart the quiz to try to get a better score if they click "Go back". 
The user can also append back to their highscore page without having to go through the entire quiz, 
by simply clicking "View Highscores".
